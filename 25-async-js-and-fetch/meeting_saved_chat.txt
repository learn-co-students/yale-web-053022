	Idk if you will mention this but some apis I‚Äôve encountered require a post request w/ headers passed in‚Äîis it possible to do POST instead of GET and also pass in http headers in JS?

	Does that include http headers w/ fetch CRUD

	So is promise like a try catch

	I am getting ‚ÄúResponse‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù

11:37:47 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	what does the log say
11:37:49 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Say you were searching in a search box‚Äîwould it make more sense to just have all of the data in the database from an api and query that (your own db) or to continuously query an external api with each search?
