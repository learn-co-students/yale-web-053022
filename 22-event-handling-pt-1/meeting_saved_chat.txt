10:07:52 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:

10:08:03 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	Sort
10:08:18 From Eten to Everyone:
	Upload something
10:08:23 From Eten to Everyone:
	Maybe a picture or a file
10:09:21 From Eten to Everyone:
	niceeee
10:12:30 From Ekow Bentsi-Enchill to Everyone:
	What’s the difference between key up and key down
10:15:02 From Paulos Thomas to Everyone:
	What’s the difference between click and mouse up?
10:16:32 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	what if u click move ur mouse over and then unclick
10:16:58 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	weirdd
10:17:37 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Maybe click requires both mouse down and mouse up
10:17:47 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	And only triggers after mouse up
10:24:35 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	With query selector does the stylesheet.css have to the selectors you pass into the fcn or does query selector just use css selectors to find stuff regardless of what’s in stylesheet.css
10:24:48 From Eten to Everyone:
	So this is an example of a callback function or is this an example for handling an event
10:27:09 From Eten to Everyone:
	No!
10:27:11 From Eten to Everyone:
	Thanks!
10:33:19 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	so weird how we can click text
10:33:54 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	from the event listener?
10:33:57 From Ekow Bentsi-Enchill to Everyone:
	^
10:34:26 From Eten to Everyone:
	Why are you passing event object into function again?
10:36:57 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Try changing the name to heading2
10:41:40 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	Hw does it mean different from the “heading”?
10:45:12 From Eten to Everyone:
	I thought javascript didn’t have explicit return
10:45:19 From Eten to Everyone:
	So you would have to write return true
10:58:09 From Eten to Everyone:
	niceeee
10:58:46 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	can we define the function inside the event listener outside and call it inside?
10:59:22 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	document.body.style.addClass something
10:59:24 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	add to the classList
11:01:10 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	check for the current class every time the function is run
11:01:11 From Eten to Everyone:
	Create a new event listener
11:01:18 From Eten to Everyone:
	Like when we click off
11:01:22 From Eten to Everyone:
	Or not lol
11:01:30 From Paulos Thomas to Everyone:
	if class is dark-mode, when clicked, switch back to toggle-dark-mode
11:02:08 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	In there a command “switch”
11:02:45 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	if !classList.include?('dark-mode')
11:03:52 From Eten to Everyone:
	How does that correlate to the click though?
11:04:06 From Eten to Everyone:
	Like the clicking event
11:04:33 From Eten to Everyone:
	Oh ok I see so we click and then it checks the condition and performs the corresponding function
11:07:58 From Michelle Rios to Everyone:
	Return Time: 11:13
11:14:12 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	could we have given the body an id instead of a class? (changing the dark mode css selector in the stylesheet accordingly too) or is a class needed to perform such events?
11:19:01 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	FORM SUBMIITEDD
11:19:18 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	I saw it
11:19:23 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	:D
11:19:42 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	post
11:21:45 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	So it won’t send the post by adding that line
11:21:57 From TJ Taek Jin Han to Everyone:
	Is it pre-established method? preventDefault
11:31:12 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	So much cleaner than ruby forms
11:39:58 From Paulos Thomas to Everyone:
	two debugger statements i think
11:46:13 From Eten to Everyone:
	Would we then have to push this new article obejct
11:46:17 From Eten to Everyone:
	Into that array
11:46:28 From Eten to Everyone:
	So the numbers can keep growing as we add more people
11:53:09 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	can you open the data.js file?
11:53:41 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	isn't the new object saved here? we pushed it to the articlesArray?
11:54:13 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	How does JS know what target is by default again?
11:54:25 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	For lines 84-87
11:54:47 From Dani Mekuriaw to Everyone:
	oh okay
11:58:49 From Anh Dang to Everyone:
	thank you!
11:58:59 From Eten to Everyone:
	Thanks!!
12:01:15 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	Why is using javascript better than ruby for this form thing
12:01:50 From Bill Feng to Everyone:
	I think part of it is if the backend isn't ruby as well
12:02:23 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	kewl
12:04:14 From Eten to Everyone:
	Is mvc still relevant with javascript
12:06:28 From Kyle Andruczk to Everyone:
	Mean/mern
12:06:30 From Eten to Everyone:
	Ok!
12:06:37 From Eten to Everyone:
	Thanks!
12:06:37 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	Couldn’t we add javascript to erb?
12:06:42 From Pranik Chainani to Everyone:
	To maintain mvc
